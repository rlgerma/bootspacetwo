## Now, with Firebase

This is a new version of an old project I started with [Carina Ullman](https://github.com/carinalullman) that connects GitHub users on a social network platform. While GitHub is perfect in every way, we felt there was a need for a supplemental platform for its users to connect more to get to know each other on a more personal level.
