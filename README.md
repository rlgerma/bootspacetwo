# bootspace 2.0
## Now, with Firebase!

This is a new version of an old project I started with [Carina Ullman](https://github.com/carinaullman) that connects GitHub users on a social network platform. While GitHub is perfect in every way, we felt there was a need for a supplemental platform for its users to connect more to get to know each other on a more personal level. 

## Changes from old version

* Migrated from Heroku to Firebase.
* Updated & minimized dependencies.
* Integration of cloud functions.
